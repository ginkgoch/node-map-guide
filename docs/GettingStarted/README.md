# Getting Started

This guide assumes primary level knowledge of JavaScript/Node.js. If you are totally new to Node.js development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.

In this page, we will talk about setting up the environment. Technically it is pretty simple as you setting up your original Node.js projects.

After the environment is ready, we will give a quick started demos for building cross platform mapping softwares for:
* Command Line Tools
* Desktop 
* Web Service
* Web Application
* Mobile (WIP...)
